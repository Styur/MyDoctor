        <p>Dear Stefi,</p>
        <p>Hai Stefi! How's your day lately? It's already 14 days since we last met at Toboali. Tidak kerasa ya, sebentar lagi internship kamu bakal selesai dalam beberapa hari lagi di Toboali. Congrats ya Stefi, kamu hebat bisa lewatin 1 tahun internship ini, well a lot of things happened, but you still did a great job, and I am proud of it. So, have you figured out what you're gonna do next? Spesialis kah? Atau apa? Well, whatever you choose to become what doctor you wanna be, I'm always supporting you, because for me, you are still my lovely doctor, a pandaüêº, and my partner.</p>
        <p>As you know what today it isüò∏, so I‚Äôm just gonna say it, Happy Valentine's Day Stefani! Meeting you was the best thing for me, because you made me want to feel love again. The moments we share, memories, they're precious to me, and all the dreams we once made, I'm always going to remember and keep them. I didn't fall in love with you just because of what you can do for me or because of just your body and the way you look, I fell in love with you because you brought back my smile again, you made me wanna fall in love once again and taught me love, you made me feel safe and cared for, you're my peace, and I'm always grateful for that.</p>
        <p>Do you know when I wake up? the first thing that pops in my mind is you. I get so excited to be able to talk to you through the day, even if I'm not physically with you. Just to talk to you in general makes me happy, you make my every day brighter, and it makes me feel like there's no one else in the world I want to be with more than you. I'm sorry for being a bad prince before. Now, I'm still gonna keep moving forward, chasing my purpose and dreams in this life, being a man, and trying to be a better version of me.</p>
        <p>Even right now, we are separated, remember that I won't give up on you. You can doubt it, you can try and push me away just because you think I'll leave you anyways, but that will never happen. I don't care if there are a hundred reasons to leave, you are the only reason I'll ever need to stay. Obstacles mean nothing if the person means everything. It doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not accepting the breakup, but for me, it was not the end. You once told me this before in one of your letters, and I'm going to say it too: "I love you yesterday, today, tomorrow, & forever".</p>
        <p>Sorry that I couldn't give you chocolate or flowers because it's Valentine's Day, so I just made this letter and a video about us. Here's the link video: <a href="https://youtu.be/NTbsHuzdSmM?si=FosqDRTjpHUCFmmv" target="_blank">Video Link</a>. when you watch it, watch alone with earphones, okay! For better experience. Once again, Happy Valentine's Day Stefi! You're always gonna be my favorite personüò∏. Take care, and see you when I see you.</p>
        <p>God bless you abundantly.</p>
        <p>From ur Bearüêª, Joshua Alberto.</p>
